"""Keep the open-PR backlog honest: one comment per PR, rewritten in place.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The bottleneck was never opening pull requests. It was that 23 sat open at once
and nothing said, per PR, whether it was *waiting on a decision* or merely
*parked*. Opening each one to find out is the tax that let the pile grow, so
this pays that tax once a day and writes the answer down.

Four facts per PR, and nothing else:

  1. mergeable or conflicting   - can it land at all
  2. CI state                   - where "no checks configured" is a THIRD state,
                                  distinct from pass and from fail. This repo has
                                  no workflows on `main`, so today every PR is in
                                  that third state. Reporting it as "passing" is
                                  exactly the lie this tool exists to prevent.
  3. days open / days idle      - idle is the one that matters; a PR touched
                                  yesterday is not stale at 30 days old
  4. reviewed, and BY WHOM      - see below

ONE COMMENT, REWRITTEN
----------------------
A daily comment per PR is how automation becomes wallpaper nobody reads. This
finds its own previous comment by the HTML marker below and PATCHes it. A PR
gets exactly one of these, ever, and the comment's edit history is the trail.

THE REVIEWER-FAMILY RULE
------------------------
Ivan's standing constraint: the reviewer must not share base weights with
whatever authored the change. A model reviewing its own family's output agrees
with itself, and agreement produced that way is worth nothing.

So this records both sides. Author family comes from commit trailers - evidence
written at commit time (`Co-Authored-By: Claude ... @anthropic.com`), not a
guess from the PR author login, which is always Ivan no matter which model wrote
the diff. Reviewer family comes from FAMILY_BY_LOGIN below, which is a DECLARED
mapping and not something any API reports. If a vendor swaps the base model
behind a reviewer bot, this file is wrong until a human edits it. That is a
known limit, written down here rather than hidden.

Same family on both sides is not something the tool can fix, so it does not try:
it prints a loud block on the PR, lists the PR in the run summary, and exits
non-zero. A human decides.

ZERO FINDINGS IS A RED FLAG, NOT A GREEN ONE
--------------------------------------------
"0% disagreement means the review is broken, not that the code is perfect."

Counting findings has one trap worth spelling out, because the obvious
implementation walks straight into it. On this repo every Codex review body is
byte-identical boilerplate - 621 characters of "Here are some automated review
suggestions" - and the actual findings are posted as INLINE comments on the
diff. A tool that measured the review body would score every review at zero
findings and report a perfectly healthy reviewer as dead. So findings are
counted from `pulls/{n}/comments`, the inline thread, per reviewer login.

STALE DRAFTS
------------
Two stages, never one. Stage 1 labels the PR and says so in the comment, with
the date recorded inside the comment body (`<!-- flagged: ... -->`) rather than
read back off the label, because labels carry no timestamp. Stage 2 closes it,
and only if the flag has been visible for --close-after-flag-days with nothing
touching the PR since. Real activity - a push, a human comment, Ivan saying "not
this one" - clears the flag and restarts the clock.

"Real activity" is NOT the PR's `updatedAt`; see last_activity_at(). Posting the
comment below bumps that field, so an earlier version of this tool reset its own
staleness clock on every run and could never have flagged anything.

Only DRAFTS are ever closed. A finished PR that went quiet gets flagged and
stays flagged; closing completed work because nobody looked at it is the
opposite of helpful.

Closing is reversible - the branch survives and the PR reopens - but it is still
an action on Ivan's repo without him in the loop, so --dry-run prints the
verdict and changes nothing. The first live run necessarily closes nothing:
nothing can have carried a flag for a week yet.

THIS TOOL NEVER MERGES. Merge authority is Ivan's and is not delegated here.

# WHAT A COPILOT REVIEW COSTS: NOT A FIXED NUMBER, AND NOT KNOWN HERE.
#
# Since 2026-06-01 every Copilot plan is on usage-based billing in GitHub AI
# Credits (1 credit = $0.01). Code review is billed by TOKEN CONSUMPTION at the
# model's API rates - input, output and cached - so its cost scales with the
# size of the diff. A 2,300-token PR and a 31,000-token PR do not cost the same.
# https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/usage-based-billing-for-individuals
#
#   Copilot Pro   $10/mo  ->  1,000 base + 500 flex  = 1,500 credits ($15)
#   Copilot Pro+  $39/mo  ->  3,900 base + 3,100 flex = 7,000 credits ($70)
#
# Credits do NOT roll over; the allowance resets to full at 00:00:00 UTC on the
# 1st of each month.
#
# The flat "13 premium requests per review" multiplier is LEGACY ONLY. It
# applies to Pro/Pro+ subscribers on an existing ANNUAL plan who stayed on
# request-based billing after 2026-06-01. Assuming it here would be the same
# class of error as the one this constant replaced: a confident number in the
# wrong unit. It is kept named, unused, so nobody reintroduces it by accident.
CREDITS_PER_REVIEW_LEGACY_ANNUAL_ONLY = 13

# Real cost per review on the CURRENT model, if it has been measured. Leave
# unset: an unmeasured cost and a cost of zero are different claims, and the
# report must not print a percentage it cannot actually compute.
#
# To measure it: note the credits used on https://github.com/settings/billing,
# run a sweep of known size, and read the delta. Then set
# COPILOT_CREDITS_PER_REVIEW to credits-per-review and the budget line becomes
# arithmetic instead of a guess.
#
# A cost of zero is not a measurement, it is a broken config: no review is
# free. Accepting it would divide by zero in render_summary AFTER the reviews
# have already been requested, turning a typo into a crash that loses the run's
# output. Non-numeric and non-positive values are refused and reported, and the
# report falls back to saying the cost is unmeasured - which is true.
