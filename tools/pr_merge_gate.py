"""Merge a pull request the moment a human approves it - and refuse otherwise.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Review without merge is where the work dies. #117 sat approved and conflicted
for six days. #176 aged into a conflict. #154 was nearly closed. Every one of
those was *finished*; what killed them was the gap between "someone said yes"
and "someone clicked the button". Ivan is not going into GitHub to click it.

So approval is the decision point and the merge follows mechanically from it.

WHY NOT `gh pr merge --auto`
----------------------------
Because on this repo it would be a no-op wearing a safety helmet. GitHub's
native auto-merge queues a PR until its *required* checks and *required*
reviews pass - and both of those live in branch protection or rulesets, which
are paid features on a private repo:

    GET /repos/ivangegovdve-sudo/hermes_agents/branches/main/protection
    403  "Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public"
    GET /repos/ivangegovdve-sudo/hermes_agents/rulesets
    403  same

    GET /repos/ivangegovdve-sudo/hermes_agents/branches/main
    -> "protected": false

With nothing required, `--auto` has nothing to wait for: it is not an approval
gate, it is an instruction to merge now. Turning it on would mean PRs merging
without any approval at all - the opposite of what was asked for.

So the gate is here, in code, where it can be read and tested. If the repo ever
goes public or the account moves to Pro, replace this with a branch protection
rule requiring one approving review plus `--auto`, and delete the file.

WHAT AUTHORISES A MERGE  (rewritten 2026-09-04 - see WHY, below)
-----------------------
An APPROVED review, on the current head, from a principal that did not write the
code.

  - THE PROPERTY IS "THE VERDICT CAME FROM A PROCESS THE ORCHESTRATOR CANNOT
    AUTHOR." Not "a different model family" - that is a CONSEQUENCE which must
    also hold, not the thing itself. The distinction is load-bearing and was
    established the hard way: a vendor list rots the moment the estate gains or
    loses a reviewer, and it passes trivially if one principal wears two model
    names.
  - The approver must be a DIFFERENT PRINCIPAL from whoever authored the diff.
    Two independent signals, both required to be clean: the approving login must
    not be a committer on the PR, and the approver's family must not appear in
    the commit trailers. The estate keeps separate Apps precisely so this can be
    checked - `ivan-codex-reviewer` reviews and never authors;
    `forest-fleet-author` and `forest-fleet-worker` author.
  - The approval must name the CURRENT head. A review of an earlier commit is
    not a review of what is about to merge, and a stale approval is how a gate
    becomes decorative.
  - The state must genuinely be APPROVED. GitHub silently degrades a review of
    one's own pull request to COMMENTED, so requiring APPROVED is also what
    excludes an author approving themselves - the case that most looks like
    compliance.
  - The approver must be on MERGE_APPROVERS: a deliberate, reviewable list of
    reviewer principals, not "anyone who can leave a review".

WHY THE HUMAN REQUIREMENT WAS REMOVED
-------------------------------------
The previous rule was "an approval from a named human, and NO BOT MAY EVER
APPROVE". It was written when a human approval was the only independence signal
available, and it made `deny_bot_approval` the most important line in the file.

It had to go, because Ivan does not review code and never has. Every merge
therefore routed around this tool, including the one on 2026-09-04 that shipped
#427. A control that everyone bypasses is worse than no control: it trains
people to bypass controls, and it makes the bypass the normal path rather than
the exception anyone would notice.

⚠ THIS IS NOT A WEAKENING, AND THE SHAPE OF THE CHANGE MATTERS. The old rule
asked "is the approver a person?". The new one asks "could the thing that wrote
this code have produced this verdict?" - which is the question the old rule was
a proxy for, asked directly. A bot may now approve; the SAME bot that wrote the
code may not, and neither may any principal that co-authored it.

There is deliberately NO override flag. A flag that disables the check is the
bypass in a nicer costume, and the reason this rewrite exists is that a bypass
already existed.

WHAT IT STILL CHECKS AFTER THE APPROVAL
---------------------------------------
Approval authorises the merge; it does not make a conflicted branch mergeable.
The PR must be open, not a draft, and MERGEABLE. CI must be green if CI exists -
and this repo has no workflows on `main`, so "no checks configured" is allowed
but is written into the audit comment verbatim rather than being quietly
rendered as a pass.

Independence is ESTABLISHED by the approving review, not inferred from the
approver being a person - that inference is what this rewrite removed. Other
reviews on the PR are recorded for the reader but are not required, because
requiring a second one would deadlock a PR on a reviewer that runs weekly.

    THIS IS THE GATE. Everything else here is hygiene; this is the property.

    Two independent signals, EITHER of which disqualifies, because they catch
    different disguises of the same thing:

      1. IDENTITY. The approving login is a committer on this PR. A principal
         cannot clear its own work, whatever it is called.
      2. FAMILY. The approver's model family appears in the commit trailers.
         This catches one principal wearing two names - a session that authors
         under one App and approves under another of the same lineage. Identity
         alone would wave that through.

    ⚠ FAMILY IS THE CONSEQUENCE, NOT THE PROPERTY. It is checked second and it
    is not sufficient on its own: two different models owned by the same
    orchestrating process are still one principal. Ordering them this way is
    deliberate, so a future edit that deletes the family check weakens the gate
    without silently removing its core.

    ⚠ ABSENT TRAILERS ARE REPORTED, NOT ASSUMED CLEAN. `author_families()`
    returns an empty set both when a human wrote the diff and when a tool left
    no trace; those are different claims and this cannot tell them apart. The
    identity check still holds in that case, which is why an empty set is not
    fatal here - but see `evaluate`, which records it rather than passing over
    it. Related, and the reason this is spelled out: on 2026-09-01 an "unknown"
    author family was routed to Codex, whose approval then counted as
    cross-family purely because the string "openai" differs from the string
    "unknown". Not knowing who wrote it is not evidence that someone else did.
